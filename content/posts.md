Greetings. I hope you're doing well today. Once a year or so I get the urge to
make my presence known to the world. Soon after I realize no one is ever going
to read about whatever I'm up to, and I end up deleting or not posting
anything.  But for anyone who may actually read this - hello and I do hope
you're doing well today.

I have been thinking of using this `me` repo for my future projects. As a
perpetual amatuer I do things that interest me at the moment. I'm not
writing any earth-shattering code here and it just seems like overkill to
create a repo just for the small, silly projects I play with.

If I put projects in their own folder under the `content` folder then the
top-level folder stays tidy :thumbsup:. Each project uses a `readme` for a
detailed explaination of that particular project.  Recent, interesting, or
popular projects can be linked from the more static top-level `readme`. The
`posts.md` can be used for blog posts and announcements.  Seems like an obvious
and simple work flow.

I think I'll try this out before pushing anything more for now.
