Greetings. I hope you're doing well today. Once a year or so I get the urge to
make my presence known to the world. Soon after I realize no one is ever going
to read about whatever I'm up to, and I end up deleting or not posting
anything.  But for anyone who may actually read this - hello and I do hope
you're doing well today.

I have been thinking of using this `me` repo for my future projects. As a
perpetual amatuer I work on things that interest me at the moment. I'm not
writing any earth-shattering code here and it just seems like overkill to
create a repo for some of the small, silly projects I have.

The way it could work is to put projects in their own folder under the
`content` folder in order to keep the top-level tidy. Each project would get
projects I think are interesting. If it works out, I'll move some of the its
own `readme` file for details, and the top-level `readme` could link to
non-popular repos here but leave the most popular in their own repos.

I think I'll try this out before pushing anything more for now.
